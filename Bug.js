This React Native bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item renderers.  The issue manifests as slow scrolling, dropped frames, and ultimately, unresponsiveness.  The root cause is often inefficient rendering of list items, leading to UI thread blockage.

```javascript
//Bug.js
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <ComplexItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

`ComplexItemComponent` might contain expensive operations like image loading, complex calculations, or nested components, each contributing to performance degradation.
