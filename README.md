# React Native FlatList Performance Optimization

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with large datasets and complex item renderers. The initial implementation exhibits slow scrolling and UI jank. The solution focuses on optimizing rendering for improved performance.

## Problem

The `FlatList` component, while efficient for many use cases, can become a performance bottleneck when rendering many complex items.  Inefficient item rendering can lead to dropped frames and an unresponsive user interface.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the rendering process using techniques like:

* **`useMemo` hook:** Memoizing expensive calculations to prevent redundant computations.
* **`React.memo`:** Preventing re-renders of components that haven't changed.
* **Virtualization techniques (if applicable):** Optimizing how the list renders items, only rendering visible ones.
* **Optimized image loading:** Using libraries like `react-native-fast-image` to improve image loading efficiency.
* **Component refactoring:** Breaking down complex components into smaller, more manageable ones for better performance.

This repository shows both the problematic implementation and the improved version, showcasing the performance differences.
