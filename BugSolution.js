The solution addresses the performance issue by optimizing the rendering process. We use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and `useMemo` for memoizing expensive calculations.

```javascript
//BugSolution.js
const ComplexItemComponent = React.memo(({item}) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    //Perform expensive calculations here
    return someExpensiveFunction(item);
  }, [item]);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... rest of the component ... */}
      <Text>{processedData.someValue}</Text>
    </View>
  );
});
```

Furthermore, consider using virtualization libraries or optimizing image loading for even better performance.  Review the `renderItem` function to identify and optimize expensive operations.
